# Verification Code Recognition with Tensorflow
There is a impletment method of the verification code recognition with Tensorflow, one using gray level image process and the other using three channel RGB image process.

# Requirements
To play with the trained model or to train the model, only need:
* Python >=3.5.4
* Tensorflow ==1.4.0

# Getting Started
To train the model, prepare for the train set, modify the path of train.py, the directly run:
```python
python train.py
```
To play with the trained model for prediction, prepare for the test set, modify the path of predict.py, run:
```python
python predict.py
```
